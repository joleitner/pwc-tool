    "title": "Survey on the aesthetic quality of group pictures",
    "text1": "We've all been there: you've been out with friends and taken some great souvenir photos. When sharing, you often end up with several series of group photos that look similar. But actually, everyone only wants the best of them, right? If you don't sort out the photos straight away, you end up with a lot of them over time. 'Now which was the nice one that I wanted to send to someone?'",
    "text2": "In my master's thesis, I would like to research whether a machine learning model can be developed that provides suggestions for aesthetic image quality. AI assistance systems already save us time and effort in many areas - so why not in our image gallery too?",
    "text3": "I need your support here! In order to reliably check the functionality of the AI model developed, I need real, labelled data for validation. This is only possible with the help of many dedicated volunteers. For validation, I use the method of forced pairwise comparison. In each case, two images are compared and the image that is subjectively perceived as more aesthetically pleasing must be selected.",

    "text1": "Thank you for taking part in the user study on the qualitative evaluation of group photos! It is often easy for us humans to decide which image we like best aesthetically. However, this often happens on a subconscious level, making it difficult to understand exactly why one image is preferred over another. In order to better understand this process, I am conducting this survey for my master's thesis. I want to investigate whether it is possible to make meaningful statements about the aesthetic quality of group images with the help of deep learning. For the validation I need your help to collect real data.",
